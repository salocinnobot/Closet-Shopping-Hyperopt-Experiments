These convolutional layers train kernels to extract \"latent features\" using backpropogation from the loss function corrections. These latent features are often abstract representations of information that allow the network to best classify the images. These convolutional layers are the basis of the CNN\n",

The function returns a positive output, only if the output is greater than 0. This output is then used as the weight for that output's input into the next layer/function. The function returns 0, if the output is less than or equal to 0, which is used as the weight for that output's input into the next layer/function. The ReLU activation function is designed to intuitively model the activation of neurons firing in the brain.\n",

The key charateristic differentiating the sigmoid function from ReLU is the exponential nature of the sigmoid which characterizes the output a non-linear curve converging out of 0, and converging into 1. Another key characteristic of the sigmoid function is it's output parameterization between 0 and 1, which raises questions into the development of an architecture by instantiating very different types of function's with very different output\n",

        "- Softmax Activation Function: A function used to determine the multinomial probabilities across the class of labels which we wish to predict. We use this function to determine the \"score\" that the image outputs to each class by leveraging the exponential function which allows that our probabilities sum up to 1. The label with the highest probability is chosen as the label for which we classify that image (talk about error from this probability)\n"
